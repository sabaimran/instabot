# Instabot
I created this tiny application so that I could ease the process of posting to Instagram. I didn't want to have to open up the app to post manually, but I still felt like it's good practice to share some of my photography on occasion.
With a bit of configuration, this script will let you publish a photo with a caption of your choosing to an account for which you have login credentials!

# Run it!
## First time
1. `conda env create environment.yml`
2. `sudo apt install firefox`
3. `chmod +x instabot.sh`
### Initialize your environment
1. Replace `username` and `password` in your config with your username and password. Remember **never** to commit & push your config!
2. Determine the classNames associated with a few different components on your Instagram web page. This is a little bit cumbersome, and I'll try to find a way around it, but for now this is the process ðŸ˜ž

| Field | Screenshot |
|-|-|
| Replace `new-post-selector` with the className for the New Post button. | ![New Post Button](docs/new-post.png) |
| Replace `button-selector` with the className for the Next button. This should cover all of our major buttons. | ![Next Button](docs/next-button.png) |
| Replace `caption-selector` with the className for the Textarea in the captioning flow.| ![Caption Textarea](docs/caption-textarea.png)|

## Each time
1. `bash -i instabot.sh`
    - Replace `sample_config.yml` with your config file.
    - The `sample_config.yml` file is preloaded with reference to a couple of test images you can use to try the tool out.

# Scheduling
I created this project so I could automate posting photos to Instagram. To run the script on a schedule, I'm using [crontab](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html). 
1. Open up your `crontab` configuration to edit.
  - `crontab -e`
2. Add the entry to schedule the `instabot.py` script.
  - `m h dom m dow DISPLAY=:0 /home/user/path/to/this-project/insta-bot/instabot.bash`
    - The `DISPLAY:=0` allows us to launch the Firefox browser via a `cronjob` in headless mode (i.e., without a display).
